;; undo
;;
;; Emacs style undo is weird in that it records the undoing as undoable, but
;; only puts it there when you type a non-undo command after a series of undos.
;;
;; Standard undo/redo in is kind of stupid, but easier to understand,
;; since when you do a modifying action after redoing, it loses your redo info.
;;
;; We're gonna do emacs style here, but see neox for the new tree style.
