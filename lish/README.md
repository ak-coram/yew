`lish` may someday be a LIsp SHell

An exercise in repeating the mistakes of the past.

NOTA BENE! / WARNING

Hopefully you are aware how dangerous and unforgiving a Unix shell can be.
Lish in no way remedies this, and instead adds complexity, many bugs, and
untested features that are likely to malfunction. It doesn't work like other
shells and will likely wreak havoc and destruction. Lish is also incomplete.
It is scheduled change in incompatible ways. Unless you have some good reason
and want to experiment in a an environment which is disposable, I recommend
you don't use it yet.
