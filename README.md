This is some kind of crust I am creating around myself, with Common Lisp.
If you are a Lisp programmer, you have likely done something similar.
You may find it interesting to look at my particular pile of junk.
Since it's _my_ pile of junk, I happen to like it.
Nothing here is at all notable yet. I'll let “you know” if it is.

What I've mostly been up to, is:

* First, I am trying to build a shell, that is also a Lisp REPL.
  I'm kind of used to typing things at a command line.
* Then I am going to (finish, translate from horrid C++) a user interface
  framework which should be able to operate in most environments.
* Then I want make a frobulator. A frobulator is a generic tool for making
  other things.

With this I can start to build actual things.

Pushing the dirt around.
