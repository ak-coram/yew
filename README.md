# When..

I'd like to stop using Bash. When I feel like I can do that, then perhaps
it will be the time to clean up the issues so other people can try to use it.

Also there's the dreaded ‘Utils’ issue!

```common-lisp
(defun org-xor (a b)
  "Exclusive or."
   (if a (not b) b))
```

I should probably od this as a ".md" since ".org" rendering is usually subpar.
Emacs can render to a ".md", but that's also subpar and needs hand tweaking.
***sigh***
