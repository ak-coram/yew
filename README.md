`lish` may someday be a LIsp SHell

NOTA BENE! / WARNING

Lish is full of bugs! Don't use it near any data that you don't want to risk
losing! Since it's a shell, it's very good at recursively wreaking havoc upon
files and commands. You may quite regularly use software highly dubious
quality, but a shell is perhaps far more dangerous than most software. Lish
is also very incomplete. It will certainly change in incompatible ways. Unless
you intrepidly want to experiment, or are interested in helping turn it into
something stable and tested, I recommend not using it yet!
