Lish TODO list							     -*- org -*-

* Before pre-release:
** fix all bugs
** do essential features
** deal with library / utils issue
* BUGS:
** fix find -d ~/ -n foo
   Be more explicit when stating bugs!!
   What is wrong?
   But it seems to fail when taking a long time and going to a pipe.
   e.g.:    find -d ~/ -n foo | less  OR even: | pager
** piping from lisp command to system command
   gets no output, e.g.: grep defun *.lisp | /usr/bin/less
** completion interning of partial symbol, so completing doesn't work right
** completion (globbing) doesn't work on non-ASCII file names? e.g. résumé
*** need unicode normalizer (see char-util.lisp)
** parsing < in first word?
** argument defaults don't work in lish commands? (see wc)
** newly defined commands don't get recognized in completion
** tiny-rl display bugs
** fix arg-option
*** fix help
*** arg completion
** argument parsing for commands
*** fix edge cases, more testing for posix-to-lisp-args
** time should work for whole pipelines
   time just times the first command in the pipeline
   e.g. time cat /usr/share/dict/words | snip -a bogus
   doesn't get the time, since it's snipped, and also it doesn't time snip
** completion should work in pipelines
   when completing in a pipeline, e.g.: cat file | grep 
   It doesn't seem to do anything, is probably trying to complete args
   for the first command, not the last command in the pipeline
** DONE fixed bugs
*** DONE completion with absolute path and stuff following, e.g.:
    "/opt/local/share/man/<here> (foo bar)"
*** DONE glob expansion of filenames with quoted spaces?
*** DONE cd to dir with spaces?
*** DONE lisp expressions after the first don't get evaluated?
* TODO option setting?
* Essential festures
** redirections: < > << <()
** give in and handle ENVVAR=value command -OR- make env builtin work
** at least handle ^Z of subprocess!
*** must be able to run code (reset job signals) after fork
*** -OR-
*** make a spawn/fork/pipe in C which handles job signals
** process stuff:
   see (defimplementation background-save-image in slime/swank/sbcl.lisp
*** chains: || &&
*** background jobs: & fg bg jobs %n ^Z SIGTSTP etc
*** jobs command
** test portability
*** implementations
**** clisp, cmu
*** linux
*** cygwin?
* Important features
** add argument specs for external programs
*** defexternal?
*** scrape --help output or man pages?
*** scrape from zsh or bash_completion dbs
*** scrape from [[https://github.com/mbrubeck/compleat][compleat]] ?
** objects (return values) as pipeline data
   Perhaps generic streams which could be object streams or character streams.
   But how to determine which one?
   Perhaps the stream is multiple/paralell? aka there is always an object
   stream, since there are always return values, AND there is a possible
   output stream which . . .
*** How About: implicit *shell-output* and *shell-input*
    that can be an sequence or and object-stream???
    Functions and commands can choose what they want to do:
    objects, text i/o, or both.
*** have shell-eval return a value: for external commands return the
    old shell exit status (from wait), otherwise the command function
    return value, or lisp return value
** figure out a syntax for multiple commands on a line (like posix ;)
** process substitution <(foo) >(foo)
** add more features to globbing (all the ignored arguments of glob)
*** brace expansion: {foo,bar}
*** recursive globbing: **
    but please let's not do too much crazy globbing, like zsh
    let's just make find-file good with symbolic query syntax
* Non-essential features
** port to windows
** syntax colorization
** suggestions from history?
** be able to call lish functions from not in the shell, ! etc
** shell specific key actions, e.g.
*** M-. cycle through pasting the last word of previous commands
*** M-o expand shell line (like bash)
** smarter completion, specifically:
*** completion should use proper completion for command line argument types
*** just basically do the ‘right thing’ in any circumstance!!!
    completion should know what you can type in any circumstance and
    provide help.
*** try git completion for example (compare to zsh)
*** consider whole path expansion, eg.: /u/l/b -> /usr/local/bin
**** also /u/s/b -> /usr/sX/b  (cursor is placed at X)
** prettier completion
*** replace under the prompt style, instead of scrolling style
*** cycle through options by repeating tab
*** colorized: filenames, etc
** completion of remote filenames? ssh scp sftp etc?
*** bash or zsh
**** greps 'Host' from ~/.ssh/config
**** greps /etc/ssh/ssh_config ??
**** greps ~/.ssh/known_hosts (but it's hashed on ubuntu)
*** sshfs
*** cl-fuse
*** cl-fuse-meta-fs
*** fuse http://fuse.sourceforge.net/ [[http://fuse.sourceforge.net/helloworld.html][helloworld.c]]
** more built-in commands (bash-like):
*** "command" command?
*** finish bind
*** ulimit
*** umask
*** wait
