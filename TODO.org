Lish TODO list							     -*- org -*-

* BUGS:
** hang going to second/continue prompt (-) when something unreadable
   (e.g. token with missing package: bogus:token)
** fix find -d ~/ -n foo
** completion bugs of // or absolute paths
** glob expansion of filenames with quoted spaces?
** completion interning of partial symbol, so completing doesn't work right
** parsing < in first word?
** cd to dir with spaces?
** argument defaults don't work in lish commands? (see wc)
** newly defined commands don't get recognized in completion
** tiny-rl display bugs
** fix arg-option
*** fix help
*** arg completion
** lisp expressions after the first don't get evaluated?
* add < redirect
* objects (return values) as pipeline data
  Perhaps generic streams which could be object streams or character streams.
  But how to determine which one?
  Perhaps the stream is multiple/paralell? aka there is always an object
  stream, since there are always return values, AND there is a possible
  output stream which...
* give in and handle ENVVAR=value command -OR- make env builtin work
* figure out a syntax for multiple commands on a line (like posix ;)
* argument parsing for commands
** fix edge cases, more testing for posix-to-lisp-args
** come up with a way to add argument specs for external programs
*** defexternal?
*** scrape --help output or man pages?
*** steal from zsh or bash_completion
* at least handle ^Z of subprocess!
** must be able to run code (reset job signals) after fork
** -OR-
** make a spawn/fork/pipe in C which handles job signals
* be able to call lish functions from not in the shell, ! etc
* work out error handling
** compilation?
** other?
* have shell-eval return a value: for external commands return the
  old shell exit status (from wait), otherwise the command function
  return value, or lisp return value
* process stuff:
** chains: || &&
** background jobs: & fg bg jobs %n ^Z SIGTSTP etc
** jobs command
* redirections: < > << <()
* smarter completion, specifically:
** completion should use proper completion for command line argument types
** just basically do the ‘right thing’ in any circumstance!!!
   completion should know what you can type in any circumstance and
   provide help.
* start/end comment syntax? #| |#, use for tops20 style completion prompts?
  Like: alias #|name|# ls #|expansion|# ls -CF
  Maybe it's better to use the first lines of of ‘?’ output as a
  description.
* add more features to globbing (all the ignored arguments of glob)
* more built-in commands (bash-like):
** "command" command?
** finish bind
** ulimit
** umask
** wait
* test portability
** implementations
*** clisp, cmu
** linux
** cygwin?
* port to windows
* edit ranting comments
* syntax colorization
* suggestions from history?
