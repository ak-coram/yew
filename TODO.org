#+OPTIONS: H:4

* BUGS:
** parsing < in first word?
** glob expansion of filenames with quoted spaces?
** cd to dir with spaces?
** newly defined commands don't get recognized in completion
** completion bugs
*** // or absolute paths
** tiny-rl display bugs
* argument parsing for commands
** fix edge cases, more testing for posix-to-lisp-args
* work out error handling
** compilation?
** other?
* have shell-eval return a value: for external commands return the
  old shell exit status (from wait), otherwise the command function
  return value, or lisp return value
* at least handle ^Z of subprocess!
* process stuff:
** chains: || &&
** background jobs: & fg bg jobs %n ^Z SIGTSTP etc
** jobs command
* redirections: < > << <()
* smarter completion, specifically:
** completion should use proper completion for command line argument types
** come up with a way to add argument specs for external programs
** just basically do the ‘right thing’ in any circumstance!!!
   completion should know what you can type in any circumstance and
   provide help.
* start/end comment syntax? #| |#, use for tops20 style completion prompts?
  Like: alias #|name|# ls #|expansion|# ls -CF
  Maybe it's better to use the first lines of of ‘?’ output as a
  description.
* add more features to globbing (all the ignored arguments of glob)
* more built-in commands (bash-like):
** "command" command?
** finish bind
** ulimit
** umask
** wait
* test portability
** linux
** cygwin?
* port to windows
